[1.0.8] - 14/12/2023
- Add ability to edit trip details including pick-up location, destination, and available seats.
- Implement trip deletion with confirmation.
- Resolve 404 error by correctly mapping trip ID in the request URL.
- Ensure robust error handling for trip management operations.

The commit includes necessary route adjustments in the trip service to accept trip IDs and updates to the corresponding functions in the console app to construct proper requests.

[1.0.7] - 14/12/2023
Introduces the ability for car owners to publish new trips.
The Trip model has been updated to include the `CarOwnerName` and `PickUpLocation` fields, ensuring that all necessary trip information is captured and stored.

Key changes include:
- Updated the Trip struct with new fields in `trip-service/models/trip.go`.
- Modified the `publishTrip` function in `console-app/main.go` to collect additional
  trip details and pass them to the trip service.
- Enhanced the `PublishTrip` handler in `trip-service/handlers/handlers.go` to handle
  the new fields and create trip records in the database.
- Ensured that the `AutoMigrate` function is called upon application start to reflect
  the new schema in the database.

The database schema has been automatically updated using GORM's `AutoMigrate` feature to include the new fields without the need for manual migrations.

[1.0.6] - 13/12/2023
