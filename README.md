# Car-Pooling Service Platform

![Platform on Console](web-frontend/images/consolehome.png)

## Introduction
This project implements a car-pooling service platform using microservices architecture. The application facilitates users to either offer car-pooling services (as car owners) or enroll in available trips (as passengers). The backend is developed in Go, interfacing with a MySQL database, and the front-end is a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Design Considerations

### Microservices
- **User Service**: Handles user authentication, profile management, and user-type upgrades.
- **Trip Service**: Manages trip creation, enrollment, and trip history.
- **Technologies**: Go for backend services, MySQL for persistent storage.
- **Communication**: RESTful APIs for microservice interaction.

### Frontend
- **Web Application**: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Interaction**: Communicates with backend microservices via AJAX calls.


## Architecture Diagram

*Placeholder for the architecture diagram showing the microservices structure and interactions.*


## Key Features

- **Password Hashing**: Implements bcrypt hashing for secure password storage, ensuring user credentials are protected.
- **Automated Trip Management**: The system automatically monitors trip schedules. Trips past their start time are automatically flagged and removed from active listings, ensuring data accuracy and relevancy.
- **User Type Flexibility**: Users can sign up as passengers and later upgrade to car owners.

## Setup and Running Instructions
1. **Backend Services**:
   - Navigate to each service directory (`user-service`, `trip-service`).
   - Run `go run main.go` to start each service.
2. **Frontend**:
   - Open the `index.html` from the `web-frontend` directory in a browser.
   - Ensure backend services are running for full functionality.

## Database Configuration
- Ensure MySQL is running and configured by creating the 2 database (`carpool` and `carpool_trips`)
- Backend services will auto create the table in the 2 database created.
