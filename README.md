Assignment 1 project for ETI module

1. Planning of Microservices
Given the requirements of the project, I can split the 2 Microservices into:
- User Service: Manages user accounts, profiles, and authentication.
- Trip Service: Handles the publishing, updating, searching, and booking of trips.

2. Defining Data Structure
For each microservice, define the necessary data structures. For example:
- User Service: User, Profile, CarOwnerProfile entities.
- Trip Service: Trip, SeatReservation entities.
